Firetracker_online is orignaly a program for follow your investment and ongoing FIRE, after reflexion i want it to be online so i can use it on any device. Why python? i don t know anything
about code so i use my friend GPT and don t want to change all the code because of the limitation of ressource (GPT FREE), so STREAMLIT seems a very good option. The code is mainly in 
portugues (working on english update).
So is an OPEN SOURCE to anybody who want to provide uptdate to the code, im realy open to everything is a non profit cause sunce im doing this just for fun and hope you enjoy it too.
